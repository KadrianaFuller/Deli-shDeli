## 💻 Why I Love This Code  

I loved writing this method because it’s like building a sandwich—every detail gets layered on perfectly! 🥪  

- **Efficient & Clean:** By using `StringBuilder`, the method is concise and avoids unnecessary overhead.  
- **Flexible & Smart:** It checks if each ingredient category (meat, cheese, toppings, sauces) is present before adding it to the description—like only adding what the customer wants!  
- **Readable & Elegant:** The use of `String.join()` creates a clean and readable list of ingredients, making the output visually pleasing.  

This method isn’t just a tool—it’s an art. It ensures every sandwich description is as detailed and delicious as the order itself. Plus, it makes debugging orders feel like a tasty adventure!
